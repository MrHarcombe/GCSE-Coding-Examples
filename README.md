# GCSEPythonExamples
Example programs I've worked through with my GCSE groups

The 'Hangman' and 'Nought and Crosses' (aka Tic-Tac_toe in the USA) were inspired/lifted-and-then-re-worked from [Ivent with Python](inventwithpython.com "Invent with Python") - a fabulous resource, if you haven't come across it.
