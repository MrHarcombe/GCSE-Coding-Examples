# GCSE Coding Examples
Example programs I've worked through with my GCSE groups

The 'Hangman' and 'Nought and Crosses' (aka Tic-Tac-Toe in the USA) were inspired/lifted-and-then-re-worked from [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com "Invent with Python") - a fabulous resource, if you haven't come across it.

The Logo flags solutions were from ideas on [CAS](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/5083/single) adapted to work on [Calormen JS Logo](https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/) rather than in Python, to give students experience of using other programming languages.
